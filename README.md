# Electronics-VIRTUAL-LAB
Virtual Basic Electronics Lab
This project is a virtual lab designed to simulate basic electronics experiments. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible to anyone with a web browser. This virtual lab is based on the Basic Electronics Lab manual (24B15EC111) from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida.

Features
Interactive Simulations: Perform experiments virtually with simulated components and instruments.

Component Library: Learn about various electronic components like resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and ICs.

Virtual Instruments: Use a virtual multimeter, breadboard, DC power supply, function generator, and CRO.

Guided Experiments: Follow step-by-step procedures for each experiment as outlined in the lab manual.

Theory and Learning: Access theoretical explanations and learning materials for each experiment.
